# Fixing Audio Playback - Solution

## Summary of Findings

After extensive testing, we've identified the following issues:

1. **Public URL Typo**: The URL in the code (`https://pub-c059baad842f47laaa2labb935e98d.r2.dev`) had a typo and didn't match the actual public URL from Cloudflare (`https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev`).

2. **No Access to R2 API**: We encountered issues with the R2 API credentials, which suggests there might be issues with the API tokens or permissions.

3. **No Files Found**: When accessing paths through the public URL, all requests returned 404 errors, which indicates either:
   - The bucket is empty (no files have been uploaded yet)
   - Files exist but are in different paths than expected
   - Public access isn't correctly configured

## Solution Steps

### 1. Fix the URL in the Code

We've already updated the URL in the code by running the `update-r2-url.js` script. This script corrected the typo in the `r2Config.ts` file, changing:

```
https://pub-c059baad842f47laaa2labb935e98d.r2.dev
```

to:

```
https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev
```

### 2. Upload Some Test Audio Files

Since it appears there might not be any audio files in the bucket (or they're not where the code expects them), you should upload test audio files:

1. Go to the Cloudflare R2 dashboard
2. Select your bucket (`prodai-beats-storage`)
3. Upload a test MP3 file to the following paths:
   - `/tracks/test.mp3`
   - `/audio/test.mp3`

### 3. Verify Public Access Settings

1. In the Cloudflare R2 dashboard, go to your bucket settings
2. Ensure "Public Access" is enabled (which you confirmed it is)
3. Verify the Public Development URL matches `https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev`

### 4. Test Access to Uploaded Files

After uploading files, try accessing them directly in your browser:
```
https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev/tracks/test.mp3
```

### 5. Update the Environment Variables

Make sure your environment variables are updated in all necessary places:

- `.env.local` file for local development
- `.env.production` file 
- Vercel environment variables (if you're deploying there)

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BASE_URL=https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev
```

### 6. Update the R2 API Credentials

If you're still having issues with the R2 API, you may need to regenerate your API tokens:

1. In Cloudflare dashboard, go to R2 â†’ "Manage R2 API Tokens"
2. Create a new API token with read/write permissions
3. Update your environment variables with the new values:
   ```
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_new_access_key
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_new_secret_key
   ```

### 7. Check File Structure in the Application

Make sure the application code expects files in the correct paths. Based on your code:

- Audio files should be in: `/tracks/{trackId}.mp3`
- Cover images should be in: `/covers/{trackId}.jpg`

### 8. Using the Correct Track IDs

When testing, make sure you're using the correct track IDs that actually exist in your system. Your metadata should have track IDs that correspond to the actual files in your bucket.

## Testing After Changes

1. Restart your development server to ensure the changes are applied
2. Run the test scripts we created to verify accessibility:
   ```
   node test-audio-url.js
   ```
3. Try playing audio on the website

## Fallback Solution

If all else fails, consider these options:

1. **Host audio files elsewhere**: You could host your audio files on another service like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or even simply in your application's public directory for testing.

2. **Create a server proxy**: Create an API endpoint in your application that fetches and serves the audio files from R2, which would bypass any client-side issues.

3. **Use a different CDN**: Connect your R2 bucket to Cloudflare's CDN or another CDN service that might handle the files differently.
