# R2 Audio Playback Fix

## Issue Summary

The audio playback was failing on the website with an error message: "Error loading audio: [track-name] may not be available."

## Root Cause

The issue was due to a typo in the Cloudflare R2 public URL used to access the audio files. 

- **Incorrect URL:** `https://pub-c059baad842f47laaa2labb935e98d.r2.dev`
- **Correct URL:** `https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev`

The issue was in the middle portion of the URL where:
- `47laaa2labb` (incorrect) 
- `471aaaa2a1bbb` (correct)

This caused the audio requests to fail as they were being sent to a non-existent domain.

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. Verified the issue by testing a specific audio file URL:
   ```
   node check-specific-track.js
   ```
   This confirmed that the correct URL could successfully access the audio files.

2. Updated the environment variables:
   ```
   node fix-environment-vars.js
   ```
   This fixed the URL in the `.env.production` file.

3. Created a new `.env.local` file with the correct URL for local development:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BASE_URL=https://pub-c059baad842f471aaaa2a1bbb935e98d.r2.dev
   ```

4. Verified that `src/lib/r2Config.ts` already had the correct URL.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the development server** - The changes will take effect after a restart.

2. **Update Vercel environment variables** - If this website is deployed on Vercel, update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BASE_URL` environment variable in the Vercel dashboard to the correct URL.

3. **Verify audio playback** - Check that audio playback works correctly after restarting the server.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Store sensitive or critical configuration values in a single, version-controlled file to avoid typos.
2. Use automated validation tools to verify URL formats and connectivity during the build process.
3. Consider creating helper scripts that validate environment variables before app startup.

## Additional Notes

The Cloudflare R2 storage appears to be set up correctly with public access to the audio files. The issue was purely related to the URL typo in the application configuration.
