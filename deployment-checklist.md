- ✅ Updated Next.js to the latest version (14.2.32)
- ✅ Added robust error handling for metadata parsing in src/lib/data.ts
- ✅ Improved detection and handling of double-encoded JSON in r2Storage.ts
- ✅ Enhanced the AudioPlayer component with better error handling and debugging
- ✅ Added detailed logging in API endpoints
- ✅ Created a debug endpoint at /api/debug for diagnostic information
- ✅ Added Vercel configuration file (vercel.json) for optimal deployment

## Environment Variables to Configure in Vercel
- [ ] R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Required for Cloudflare R2 access
- [ ] R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Required for Cloudflare R2 access
- [ ] R2_ENDPOINT - Your Cloudflare R2 endpoint
- [ ] R2_BUCKET - Your Cloudflare R2 bucket name
- [ ] NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_BASE_URL - URL to your CDN (e.g., 'https://cdn.prodaibeats.com')
- [ ] NODE_ENV - Set to 'production' for production builds

## Remaining Tasks
- ✅ Update Next.js to the latest version (currently using 14.2.32)
- ✅ Run a production build locally to test for any additional issues: `npm run build`
- [ ] Ensure all metadata files in R2 are properly formatted and not double-encoded
- [ ] Verify audio files exist at the expected URLs in the CDN
- [ ] Make sure Cover images exist at the expected URLs in the CDN
- [ ] Perform final tests of the audio player in a local production build

## Final Checks
- [ ] Confirm that the tracks are displayed correctly in the UI
- [ ] Verify that audio playback works correctly
- [ ] Ensure cover images are displayed properly
- [ ] Check that all track metadata (title, artist, duration, etc.) is displayed correctly

## Monitoring After Deployment
- [ ] Check server logs for any R2 connection issues
- [ ] Monitor for any "No tracks found" errors
- [ ] Watch for missing metadata or audio files
- [ ] Verify CDN access is working properly

## Notes
- We've added comprehensive error handling for metadata parsing
- We've improved the fallback values for missing track information
- The AudioPlayer component now has enhanced error handling
- Debug API endpoint is available at `/api/debug` for diagnostics
- Our fixes should handle both properly formatted and double-encoded metadata files
