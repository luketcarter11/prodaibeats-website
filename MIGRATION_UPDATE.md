# File Path Update Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated file paths**:
   - Changed both data modules to read from `data/tracks.json` instead of `tracklist.json` in the root directory
   - Updated `downloadTracks.js` to save to `data/tracks.json` instead of `tracklist.json`
   - Ensured data is migrated from `tracklist.json` to `data/tracks.json`

2. **Environment variable cleanup**:
   - Removed Supabase-related environment variables from `.env.production`
   - Ensured no Supabase credentials are referenced in environment files

3. **Documentation updates**:
   - Updated `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` to reflect the new file paths
   - Added proper file structure documentation

## Verification Steps

1. **Code changes verified**:
   - Both data modules (`lib/data.ts` and `src/lib/data.ts`) now read from `data/tracks.json`
   - `downloadTracks.js` now saves to `data/tracks.json`
   - All references to `tracklist.json` have been updated

2. **Data migration verified**:
   - Confirmed that `data/tracks.json` has been created with the same content as `tracklist.json`
   - Verified that the file structure matches the expected format

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the website locally to ensure it loads track data correctly
   - Verify the beats page and individual track pages load properly
   - Confirm that audio playback works with the updated file paths

2. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy to Vercel and verify everything works in the production environment
   - Confirm that new tracks downloaded via `downloadTracks.js` appear on the site

3. **Cleanup**:
   - Once everything is working correctly, you can remove `tracklist.json` from the root directory
   - Consider adding `tracklist.json` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent confusion
